# About
Welcome to the Metis project repository! This project is dedicated to the design, manufacture, and control of a delta robot entirely from scratch.

# Key Features
- *3D Printed Components*: Very affordable design, using only standard components.
- *ROS2 Integration*: [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) running on the laptop.
- *Micro-ROS on ESP32*: Low-level firmware to control the robot.
- *URDF*: Unified Robot Description Format of the delta robot.
- *Numerical Inverse Geometry*: Algorithm integration of the [Pinocchio library](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).
- *Graphical User Interface*: A simple GUI to directly control the robot.
- *G-Code Parser*: Possibility to write your own gcode for your custom task.
- *Object Detection with OpenCV*: Possibility to integrate object detection algorithms for pick and place tasks.

# Documentation
