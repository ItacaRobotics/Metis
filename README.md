# About
Welcome to the Metis repository! This project is dedicated to the design, manufacture, and control of a delta robot entirely from scratch. All mechanical components are open-source and available in the documentation. Follow the setup guide to install the software on your laptop.

# Key Features
- *Open-source 3D Printed Components*
- *ROS2 Integration*
- *URDF Description*
- *Micro-ROS on ESP32*

# Documentation
A more detailed documentation can be found [here](/docs/).
- **Mechanical components**: STEP files and bill-of-materials.
- **Software architecture**: how the project is structured and how to interact with the robot.
- **How to guides for using single tools**
    - *trajectory generator*: Python class to generate velocity and acceleration constrained trajectories.
    - *inverse geometry*: Numerical inverse geometry, with Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm.
