# Metis
The Metis project aims to design, manufacture and control a delta robot. It has been designed with off the shelf components and 3D printed parts. The software is ROS2 based, with micro-ROS integration. Further developements have been made to support gcode and object detection for pick and place tasks.

### Mechanics and Electronics
The 3D printed mechanical components are fully open-source and can be found [here](/assets/CAD).

The motherboard used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-DLC32).
